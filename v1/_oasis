Description:
  A library to build interdependent computations whose result are stored in files
  . 
  This library provides some tools to describe and run a set of
  interdependent computations whose results are stored in files, just
  like GNU make does. The analoguous of a make target is called a
  pipeline, and rules are specified as a function, instead of shell
  commands. Pipelines can be composed in several ways, keep track of
  the other pipelines they depend on and are typed to reflect the
  value they build. Guizmin can hence be used to build chains of
  computations that are both dependency-aware (to avoid useless
  rebuild, like in make) and statically typechecked.
