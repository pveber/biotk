* Purpose
  Guizmin is a tool for deriving a bioinformatics pipeline from a
  collection of datasets. The resulting pipeline is in charge of
  producing informative documents based on the datasets and among them
  a relational database, used for further analysis.

  The main features are:
  - accepts a human-readable text description of the available datasets
  - library to build pipelines piggy-backing on ocaml typechecker
  - accepts a 
  - cache results of a pipeline
  - error recovery
  - updates based on dependencies
  - parallel execution
