(**
   Data structures to represent sets of (possibly annotated) genomic regions

   This module is useful to deal with sets of genomic regions. It
   provides set operations like union, intersection, difference or
   membership tests. Specific data types are also provided when the
   regions are annotated with some value.

   Genomic regions are represented as a pair formed by a range and an
   abstract representation of a sequence/chromosome identifier. The
   data structures implemented here are parameterized over this
   abstract type. To obtain an implementation for the most common case
   where chromosomes are identified with a string, simply apply the
   functor [Make] on the [String] module.

   The functor [Make] provides four datatypes, which corresponds to
   variants where:

   - the regions in the set can overlap or not

   - the regions are annotated with some values

  (** [of_stream e] computes a selection (i.e. a set of non
      overlapping locations) as the union of the locations contained
      in [e] *)

(** A set of locations (e.g. a set of gene loci) *)

  val intersects : t -> GLoc.t -> bool
  (** [intersects lset loc] returns [true] if [loc] has a non-empty
      intersection with one of the locations in [lset], and returns
      [false] otherwise *)

  val closest : t -> GLoc.t -> (GLoc.t * int) option
  (** [closest lset loc] returns the GLoc.t in [lset] that is the
      closest to [loc], along with the actual (minimal)
      distance. Returns [None] if there is no GLoc.t in [lset]
      that comes from the same chromosome than [loc]. *)

  val intersecting_elems : t -> GLoc.t -> GLoc.t Stream.t
  (** [intersecting_elems lset loc] returns a stream of all
      locations in [lset] that intersect [loc]. *)

  (** [closest lmap loc] returns the GLoc.t in [lmap] that is the
      closest to [loc], along with its annotation and the actual (minimal)
      distance. Returns [None] if there is no GLoc.t in [lmap]
      that comes from the same chromosome than [loc]. *)

  val intersecting_elems : 'a t -> GLoc.t -> (GLoc.t * 'a) Stream.t
  (** [intersecting_elems lmap loc] returns a stream of elements
      in [lmap] whose GLoc.t intersects with [loc]. *)
